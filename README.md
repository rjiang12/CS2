# CS2
Projects completed as part of CS2 course @ Caltech during freshman year (Winter 2021/22)

All projects are imported from Gitlab, where the assignments are handed in and tested. Full marks were achieved on every single project and lab in the course, but I've selected (what I believe to be) the most interesting projects to include here. 

Project 1: Ciphers 

Project 2: Hangman word choosers (standard and evil algorithm) and solvers (AI)

Project 3: Guitar synthesizer (Deques, Stacks, Queues)

Project 4: Movie autocomplete (Tries, trees)

Project 6: Text chat with autocomplete, spell check, and word suggestion (Heaps, trees)

Lab 7: Maze Solver (N-ary trees, Recursive and iterative DFS)
